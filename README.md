This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my data analysis course

I have learnt quite several things in this DSA class, ranging from Excel, SQL, and portfolio building

## **Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the e-commerce platform over the past year. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, we aim to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions, which will enable us to tell compelling stories around our data and identify the best performance from our data.
